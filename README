* About

This repository follows a nice series of blog posts about writing a rougelike
game in C++. I'm doing it in Ada as a fun way to learn the language.

I also think that with time, this may serve as a nice snippet base for writing
ncurses applications in Ada.

I try to keep most of the code as close to the original snippets as possible,
including verbatim comments from the snippets in the blog post.

Each commit should generally refer to a single snippet visible in the blog,
representing a runnable state of the program.

The code will diverge with time if I decide to continue working on it.

* Current state

Currently working on:
 Roguelike game in C++ - Bootstrap
 http://solarianprogrammer.com/2012/07/12/roguelike-game-cpp-11-part-1/

* Requirements
An Ada compiler and the ncurses bindings from http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/

If you are running on Ubuntu works great to have the libraries going:
 sudo apt-get install libncursesada2 libncursesada2-dev

You might need to adjust ncursesada.gpr the one commited was installed by apt-get on my system.

* Compilation

gnatmake -P crawler.gpr
